                <div class="poem-title">Boredom</div>
                <p>Do you remember when you could create a world,<br>
                Where no one could enter, your secrets unfurled?<br>
                Do you remember when silence alone<br>
                Filled the mind with ideas, a laughter well-known,<br>
                That laughter, so pure, one of a kind,<br>
                Echoing softly in the heart and the mind.<br>
                Oh, I reminisce on the days forever missed,<br>
                When boredom had no place, it didn't exist.<br>
                My mind, so endless, soared high above,<br>
                Imagination took the crown, and kingdoms were loved.<br>
                Oh, how I reminisce on those days,<br>
                Where every thought would set fire to the maze.<br>
                Do you remember when you could relieve that feeling?<br>
                The feeling of nothing to do, so appealing.<br>
                Do you remember when all that it took<br>
                Was a mystery to solve, a forgotten book?<br>
                But now, it feels like I'm missing the clue,<br>
                The magic of moments that once came through.</p>

            <div class="poem">
                <div class="poem-title">Petals & Static</div>
                <p>everything I know about love,<br>
                full of untold secrets.<br>
                bell jar, unraveled-<br>
                a woman’s mind, her rationale.<br>
                bunny, I love you,<br>
                bunny, you’re sooo cute.<br>
                a woman’s world.<br>
                holding the intrinsic lust of intellect.<br>
                in a woman’s world they are fierce-<br>
                with metallic spikes<br>
                and bubblegum bows.<br>
                a singular petal drifting,<br>
                its beauty known<br>
                through every sense.<br>
                for she is the one<br>
                who dances in the wind.<br>
                a woman’s world.<br>
                like novels you fall inside,<br>
                where soul and story intertwine.<br>
                orchids bloom again and again-<br>
                so too shall she cradle you,<br>
                year after year.<br>
                a woman’s world:<br>
                soft but hard.<br>
                for softness is truth,<br>
                and strength wears a gloss.<br>
                synesthesia surging,<br>
                it’s just as they are:<br>
                feeling, seeing,<br>
                living through scars.<br>
                we giggle, we gossip,<br>
                we carry the unseen-<br>
                something sacred,<br>
                something vital,<br>
                something bright beneath the lace.<br>
                not built to be understood,<br>
                only to endure in elegance.<br>
                in a woman’s world<br>
                we flow with the tides,<br>
                we sync with the moon,<br>
                we are our own brides.<br>
                a sacred bond with one another-<br>
                language passed in glances,<br>
                half-remembered lullabies.<br>
                mirror-slick and ever-shifting,<br>
                like silk over bone.<br>
                she is not yours to know,<br>
                only to notice<br>
                in the hush between moments,<br>
                in the static<br>
                before the song plays.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poem">
                <div class="poem-title">Barefoot</div>
                <p>The grass cools against my soles<br>
                as I step past the warning of my mother’s voice,<br>
                the one that says, Don’t go barefoot,<br>
                but I do anyway-<br>
                the blades tickling my arches,<br>
                each step an act of rebellion,<br>
                soft underfoot until the earth begins to hum,<br>
                and the cicadas join in,<br>
                their song rising like a heat wave,<br>
                filling the evening with a pulse,<br>
                thrum, thrum, thrum.<br>
                The sky is a velvet stage for fireworks,<br>
                the air heavy with salt and smoke.<br>
                We run-<br>
                feet slapping,<br>
                bare against the grass,<br>
                heartbeats matching the bursts above.<br>
                I feel the burn in my legs,<br>
                the ache of freedom,<br>
                then-<br>
                Ouch!<br>
                A rock underfoot, sharp and unforgiving,<br>
                but I climb anyway-<br>
                how could I resist?<br>
                The tide pools,<br>
                those little worlds trapped in time,<br>
                they whisper secrets-<br>
                look here,<br>
                find a treasure,<br>
                so I become the detective.<br>
                The beach tugs at me like a magnet,<br>
                sand slipping between my toes,<br>
                hotter than I imagined,<br>
                but I don’t care-<br>
                I’m too busy<br>
                watching the ocean swallow the sun,<br>
                my feet sinking deeper into the earth,<br>
                chasing the sound of the ice cream truck.<br>
                The bell rings in the distance,<br>
                sweet and familiar,<br>
                a tune that means more than just sugar-<br>
                it means everything.<br>
                I bite off the layer of chocolate crunch,<br>
                cracking it with my teeth<br>
                before licking the ice cream,<br>
                cool and sweet,<br>
                melting faster than I can catch it.<br>
                I hear the crickets now,<br>
                their chorus a lullaby for the end of the day,<br>
                and then-<br>
                the fireflies.<br>
                Tiny stars flicker in the dark,<br>
                catching my breath<br>
                like something forgotten-<br>
                when was the last time<br>
                I saw a firefly?<br>
                The salty water clings to my skin,<br>
                the sun already starting to evaporate<br>
                my wet body,<br>
                leaving me sticky<br>
                as the sand coats me,<br>
                a second skin I can’t shake.<br>
                My mother’s voice again,<br>
                this time more gentle-<br>
                a rinse,<br>
                a shower,<br>
                a quick scrub before the ride home.<br>
                But I am still barefoot in my story,<br>
                the world still alive beneath my feet-<br>
                no matter how much they tell me to put shoes on,<br>
                Barefoot, I keep summer in my body-<br>
                its grit in my skin,<br>
                its sugar on my tongue,<br>
                and sometimes, when the world goes quiet,<br>
                I can still hear it humming underfoot.</p>
